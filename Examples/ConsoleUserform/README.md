# Console

A custom userform-based console for usage in VBA projects. Developed by @Almesi in a [PR for stdVBA](https://github.com/sancarn/stdVBA/pull/110). Rejected as per comments in [discussion](https://github.com/sancarn/stdVBA/discussions/107#discussioncomment-10119390) but uploaded here as an example, as this will use stdVBA modules.

## WIP

This example is still under construction, and currently is not reliable enough.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Migrate evaluation code to use `stdLambda`
- [ ] Ensure functions need to be registered by default
- [ ] Ability to use colored text
- [ ] Use `stdUIElement`
- [ ] Intellisense / Auto-Complete
